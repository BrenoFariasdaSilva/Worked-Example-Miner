## Goals

1. Similarity Analysis:
   - We analyze different similarity algorithms, including Word2Vector, Yake, Sentence Bert, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) to evaluate the similarity between texts.
   - We create two datasets based on these similarity calculations: one for storing solved (answered) questions and another for storing unsolved questions.
   - Using these datasets, we determine the most similar solved questions for each unsolved question and auto-recommend changes based on the similarity of those questions.

2. Enhancing Code Solutions:
   - We study the use of tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to improve students' code solutions when they are stuck.
   - Currently, we utilize CK to generate Code Metrics for repositories like Apache Commons-lang and Jabref.
   - We employ PyDriller to traverse the commit tree in the repository and run CK for every commit hash it is in.
   - This allows us to gather code metrics such as CBO, CBOModified, WMC, RFC, and others to create graphics depicting the metrics evolution of specific classes or methods within the repository.

3. Analyzing Code Evolution:
   - With the collected data and code metrics, we analyze code that started with "bad" metrics and evolved over time.
   - We aim to identify good code examples that indicate what makes code better and what changes are typically made to improve it.

4. Providing Data to AI Tools:
   - We gather valuable data to provide to tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, showcasing what constitutes good code and why.
   - We explore how contextual information, such as code samples, can assist these tools in suggesting better code improvements for students.
