### Worked Example Miner: A Comprehensive Tool for Java Repository Analysis

This project introduces the "Worked Example Miner", an innovative tool designed to streamline and enhance the analysis of Java repositories. By aggregating the capabilities of several established tools, it provides a robust framework for generating detailed data and metadata pivotal for examining repository evolution, identifying trends, and selecting prime candidates for creating worked examples. Here's how Worked Example Miner integrates these tools to offer a multifaceted analysis approach:

- **CK (Chidamber & Kemerer):** Utilized for its adeptness in collecting and analyzing code metrics, CK plays a crucial role in our tool by generating essential code metrics for repositories such as Apache Commons-lang and Jabref.

- **PyDriller:** This Python framework excels in mining software repositories. Within Worked Example Miner, PyDriller is harnessed to navigate through the commit tree of a repository, facilitating the execution of CK at every commit, thereby ensuring a comprehensive analysis across the development timeline.

- **RefactoringMiner:** Renowned for its ability to detect refactorings within Git repositories, RefactoringMiner is incorporated to pinpoint code modifications that signify evolution. This insight is invaluable in understanding the adaptive measures taken throughout a project's lifecycle.

By leveraging the combined strengths of these tools, Worked Example Miner emerges as a powerhouse for Java repository analysis. It not only facilitates the generation of differential analyses for each commit but also meticulously tracks the historical progression of selected CK metrics at each stage of code development. Furthermore, the tool is equipped to conduct linear regression analyses, detect substantial changes, and identify refactoring types cataloged by RefactoringMiner.

The integration of these capabilities allows Worked Example Miner to produce an array of outputs, from detailed commit diffs to analyses of repository evolution and potential trends. Such comprehensive data is instrumental in pinpointing exemplary candidates for the creation of worked examples, thus enriching educational resources and facilitating a deeper understanding of Java repository dynamics.

In essence, Worked Example Miner stands as a testament to the synergy of combining specialized tools to achieve a greater understanding of software development practices by the code metrics evolution. Through its detailed analyses, educators, researchers, and developers are better equipped to study Java repositories, enabling the cultivation of rich, informative worked examples that highlight best practices and evolutionary insights in software development.

### Code Analysis

We analyze instances where code initially demonstrated suboptimal metrics but evolved positively over time. Identifying exemplary modifications sheds light on effective practices for code improvement, focusing on alterations that enhance metric scores.

## Research Questions

Our investigation is guided by four principal questions:

1. How to identify relevant code quality metrics for analyzing DS evolution?
2. What patterns and trends signify clear code improvement in DS?
3. How do code improvements reflect on selected metrics and their correlation with non-functional characteristics?
4. Which metrics and characteristics are crucial for selecting appropriate code examples for educational purposes in Software Engineering (SE)?

## Proposed Approach

The project aims to develop a heuristic for identifying code examples that represent quality improvements in DS. This heuristic will aid in selecting code segments for educational examples, illustrating the adaptation and evolution of DS code over time. The heuristic will focus on improvements detectable through selected metrics, using specific tools on carefully chosen open-source repositories.

### Software Metrics

We rely on a suite of metrics for object-oriented design as outlined in "A Metrics Suite for Object Oriented Design," focusing on:

- **Coupling Between Object classes (CBO)**
- **Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT)**
- **Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM)**
- **Number of Children (NOC)**
