Welcome to the Refactoring Miner folder, in which you will find the scripts used to generate the refactoring miner refactoring scripts of the metrics evolution of a class or method of the repositories of interest.  
RefactoringMiner is a valuable tool for software maintenance and evolution analysis, helping developers and researchers understand how code evolves over time through refactorings.

# Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.x
- Git
- AtExit library (included in the project)
- Colorama library (included in the project)
- RefactoringMiner tool (included in the project)
- Pandas library (included in the project)
- PyDriller library (included in the project)
- Scikit-learn library (included in the project)
- TQDM library (included in the project)

# Installation

To install and set up the required environment for the script, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/BrenoFariasdaSilva/Scientific-Research
  ```

2. Navigate to the `RefactoringMiner` directory:
   
  ```shell
  cd Scientific-Research/RefactoringMiner
  ```

3. Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

  ```shell
  make dependencies
  ```

1. Run the desired scripts using the following command:

  ```shell
  make repositories_refactors_script
  ```
  or 
  ```shell
  make metrics_evolution_refactors_script
  ```

# Usage

## Repository Refactors

To use the script for repository refactor analysis, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the `RefactoringMiner` directory.

2. Run the script using the following command:

  ```shell
  make repositories_refactors_script
  ```
## Metrics Evolution Refactors

In order to use the script for the analysis of the metrics evolution of a class or method, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the PyDriller Metrics Evolution files that should be located as follows, otherwise it will not work:
  ```shell
  Scientific-Research/PyDriller/metrics_evolution
  ```
2. If you have the PyDriller Metrics Evolution files, simply open a terminal in the `RefactoringMiner` directory and run the script using the following command:

  ```shell
  make metrics_evolution_refactors_script
  ```

# Workflow

Here's a brief overview of how the script works:

1. It defines several constants, paths, and default values used throughout the script.

2. The script checks for prerequisites and directory structures.

3. It clones or updates a specified GitHub repository using Git or opens the generated files by PyDriller.

4. For each class or method specified in `FILES_TO_ANALYZE`, it generates refactoring data for commits in the repository concurrently, using multiple threads.

5. Refactoring data is stored in JSON files in the `json_files` directory.

# Python Scripts

In this section, we provide explanations for each function in the provided Python script and introduce RefactoringMiner, an essential tool used by the script.

## Metrics Evolution Refactors
Before running the script, be sure to modify the following variables to suit your needs:  
`DESIRED_REFACTORING_TYPES` - The refactoring types to be analyzed. Must names of the refactorings detected by RefactoringMiner. See more [here](https://github.com/tsantalis/RefactoringMiner#general-info).  
`DEFAULT_REPOSITORY` - The default repository to clone or update. Must be a value that is in the DEFAULT_REPOSITORIES dictionary.  
`FILES_TO_ANALYZE` - The files to analyze in the repository must be names of classes or methods that were generated by PyDriller.  

1. The first thing this script does is verify  if the path contains whitespace, if so, it will not work, so it will ask the user to remove the whitespace from the path and then run the script again.
2. 

## Repository Refactors

# RefactoringMiner JSON Output

The script generates JSON files containing refactoring data for commits in the specified classes or methods of the repository. These files are organized in the `json_files` directory, following the repository's structure.

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the script, consider the following:

- Ensure that you have the required prerequisites installed and available in your system.

- Check the repository URL and make sure it is accessible.

- Verify that the paths specified in the script are correct, and the necessary directories exist.

- Verify if you have the PyDriller Metrics Evolution files that should be located as follows, otherwise it will not work:
  ```shell
  Scientific-Research/PyDriller/metrics_evolution
  ```
